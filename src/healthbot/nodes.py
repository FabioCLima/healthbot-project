"""HealthBot Graph Nodes.

This module contains all the node functions that process the HealthBot graph state.
Each function represents a specific step in the conversation workflow, from initial
user interaction to quiz generation and evaluation.

The nodes are organized into three main categories:
- User Interaction Nodes: Handle communication with the user
- Processing Nodes: Perform core functionality (search, summarize)
- Quiz System Nodes: Generate and evaluate educational quizzes

All nodes follow the LangGraph pattern of receiving a HealthBotState and returning
a dictionary with state updates.
